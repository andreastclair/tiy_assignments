##Problems
The current Goodreads site is too cluttered. There is a lack of overall hierarchy which makes navigation confusing. With all of the site's features displayed, it's difficult for the user to tell what's the most important and where their attention should go first. There is no clear difference in type treatment for links. 

##Goals
[] Define hierarchy on all pages. 
[] Make the site easier to navigate. 
[] Reduce clutter.

##Solutions
[] Use color and font-sizes to define hierarchy. 
[] Use the Gestalt principles to group like elements together, making the site easier to navigate. 
[] Combine elements into dropdown menus.
