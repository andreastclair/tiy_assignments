				<h2>I WANNA LOVE YOU, BUT I KIND OF HATE YOU</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Dear jQuery,</p>
				<br>
				<p>Well, we did it. We went on our first date. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about you. First impressions are really important to me, and you just came off as the most vague, sneaky and overly-complicated bully I&#39;ve ever met. But then, you&#39;d make me smile. Smile so big that I forgot how uncomfortable you&#39;d just made me, until a few seconds later when you&#39;d knock me down again. Why so cruel, jQuery? Why?</p>
				<br>
				<p>I realize that this is kind of heavy, especially after only one date, but I can&#39;t keep it in, jQuery. I need you to know.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I&#39;m big on first impressions, but we&#39;re all human (well, most of us anyway). I know that they aren&#39;t always the best representation of our character. We all get nerves, I get that. But I&#39;m really trying here. I&#39;m trying to love you.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Your friends all talked you up. Everyone said that you were so much fun. Maybe it&#39;s my fault for putting you on a pedestal. We spent the whole afternoon and evening together, and I feel like you got so much more of my soul than I got of yours. I shared with you my struggles and my fears, I spoke to you openly, I gave you my code to do with as you please, I let myself be totally vulnerable in your presence. And what did you do? You took the last slice of pizza.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I don&#39;t want to spend my time with another fixer-upper. Gone are the days where I&#39;ll tolerate being in a one-sided relationship. But I need you, and I&#39;m woman enough to admit that. I don&#39;t want to sound desperate, but I&#39;ll hold no bitter resentment that you took that last slice of za if you&#39;ll just be my friend. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is, I&#39;m just a girl, standing in front of a javascript library, asking it to click with her.</p>
				<br>
				<p>My dear jQuery, I want to love you, but right now, I kind of hate you.</p>
				
				<h3>Love, Andrea</h3>

				<p>P.S. Here&#39;s what I got from you tonight. I&#39;m only partially satisfied, but I&#39;m not opposed to second chances. Until next time, jQuery.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This is for the Goodreads site redesign. When you click on a book in your shelf, the modal will pop up with a description of the book. Click close and it flips back to the cover. Voila!</p>

				<p>These are tabs for the profile page of the Goodreads redesign. A user can switch between tabs to show the different sections of their page.</p>

				<br>
				<p>The stars, oh my. This is for the rating system on Goodreads so that users can rate the books that they&#39;ve read. I managed to get one done, I will hopefully figure out how to get all the way to 5 stars on my second date with jQuery.</p>
