				Hello there! I'm <a href="http://www.andreadoris.com">Andrea St. Clair</a>. 
			</h2>
			<p>I'm a doodler, dancer, and 80s music enthusiast living in Austin, Texas. I blew into town from Oklahoma seven years ago, drawn to all of the vibrant colors that Austin has to offer. What's my favorite color, you ask? I love all of the colors! So I found my happy place in a city that is rich with culture, music, food, and art. Since moving here, I've been lucky enough to dance my socks off to a few 80s favs including Hall and Oates, New Order, The Cure, Cyndi Lauper, Blondie, and Depeche Mode. And almost nightly, Bowie makes a speacial appearance in my living room.</p>
			
			<p>I live with my husband of almost one year and together, we have two cats, an excellently eclectic vinyl collection, and an affinity for action movies, pizza, and bourbon.</p>
			
			<p>Meet my quirky little family.</p>
